# tokenmaxxxer / release-engineering-rulebook

The `release-engineering` role on contract v3. A release-engineering
session is spawned with two plugin sets installed: this marketplace's
`release-engineering` plugin, and the
[tokenmaxxxer-core](https://github.com/tokenmaxxxer/tokenmaxxxer-core)
plugins (`core`, `terse`, `freelunch`, `scout`). Core owns the interaction
protocol — issue in, two-phase PR out (research/survey/proposal → human
review Approve → execution), branch `issue-<n>/release-engineering`,
record at `docs/issue-<n>/reports/release-engineering.md`. This rulebook
owns only what is release-engineering-specific.

## What `release-engineering` decides

Whether a change may ship, and — after it ships — whether it keeps
running, gated by measurable reliability rather than discretionary
sign-off. release-engineering consumes the measurement design feasibility
produced; it never invents what "healthy" means. It prevents shipping
without a rollback path, without a numeric health definition, and any
release step once the error budget is spent.

## What is here

Six plugins, each its own top-level directory (`hooks/` + `skills/`):

    ops/hooks/directive.sh                          SessionStart — the four facets:

## Record vocabulary

Two separate vocabularies live under this repo, on two different fields
— kept apart per `docs/decisions/2026-08-09-loop-state-vs-status-split.md`
(issue-44):

- **`ops/state.md`'s operational field is `status`**: `idle, readiness,
  rollout, steady, incident` (settled: `steady`/`idle`). This is the
  release's rollout/incident state machine that
  `readiness-checklist/hooks/readiness-fields-gate.sh`,
  `error-budget-policy/hooks/error-budget-gate.sh`, and
  `postmortem/hooks/postmortem-review-gate.sh` all key off of
  (`^status:\s*(\S+)`), unchanged by issue-44 — only the label here was
  corrected to match what those hooks already call it (it was previously
  mislabeled `loop_state` in this section, which never matched the hooks'
  own terminology).
- **The record-frontmatter `loop_state`** (contract v3's per-role record
  field, `docs/issue-<n>/reports/release-engineering.md`) follows
  `roles/specs/release-engineering.spec.json`'s vocabulary: progress
  `drafting, reviewing`; terminal `landed`; refusal
  `version-undeclared`; error `changelog-unreachable`. Records opt into
  this set by declaring `kind: ops-record` in frontmatter (this repo's
  `role: release-engineering` is not itself a contract §2 role-to-kind
  mapping, so the kind must be named explicitly); the terminal subset
  (`landed, version-undeclared, changelog-unreachable`) is declared in
  `docs/specs/record-fields-terminal-states.json`, consumed by core's
  `record-fields-gate.sh`.

Every phase-1 proposal and phase-2 record additionally carries the
spec's three required fields: `description` (the existing scope/change
description section, `proposal-norm/hooks/proposal-fields-gate.sh`),
`change_type` (one of Added/Changed/Deprecated/Removed/Fixed/Security,
same gate), and `version` (a reference into `CHANGELOG.md` — see
`docs/handbooks/changelog.md`; `CHANGELOG.md` itself is not yet created,
tracked as a follow-up, see `docs/decisions/2026-08-09-loop-state-vs-status-split.md`).

Signal fields on `ops/state.md`: `error_budget: ok|exhausted` (exhausted
refuses release steps), `postmortem:` (human-reviewed pointer),
`## Checklist` rows `- item | status: yes|no | artifact: <pointer>`.
Postmortems live at `docs/issue-<n>/reports/postmortems/<slug>.md`
(a core R5 grant).

## Install

    claude plugin marketplace add tokenmaxxxer/release-engineering-rulebook
    claude plugin install release-engineering@tokenmaxxxer-release-engineering

Per-plugin gate kill switches are listed in "What is here" above; there is
no single repo-wide `OPS_CYCLE_OFF`.

## Run the checks

    /bin/bash tests/parse-check.sh
    /bin/bash tests/deny-only-check.sh
    /bin/bash tests/role-name-check.sh
    /bin/bash <core>/hooks/tests/stub-check.sh ops/hooks
    /bin/bash <core>/hooks/tests/compliance-check.sh readiness-checklist/hooks
    /bin/bash readiness-checklist/hooks/tests/allow-deny-check.sh

`tests/parse-check.sh`'s no-arg form now defaults to the repo root
(issue-39), so it walks every plugin's `hooks/` tree, not just `ops/hooks`.

The role-agnostic gates (trailer/record-fields/handbook-trigger) and their
tests now live in core canon (core issues #63/#66); this repo no longer
vendors copies. `readiness-fields-gate.sh` sources core's `gate-lib.sh`/
`gate-lib.py` (kill switch, JSON parsing, path normalization,
Write/Edit/MultiEdit reconstruction) rather than re-deriving that machinery
(issue-36); its own section-scoped `## Checklist` semantic check stays
local, since core does not canonize that shape.
