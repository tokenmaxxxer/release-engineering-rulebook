# On a write whose resolved target is docs/issue-<n>/proposals/*.md,
# require the RFC-shaped proposal sections adopted in

# change description, risk (a named failure mode), rollback / back-out
# path, and at least one inline evidence citation (URL or repo path) for an
# adopted-methodology claim. Same shape/fail-closed discipline as core's
# record-fields-gate.sh, applied to this role's own proposal documents.

# Kill switch: export PROPOSAL_FIELDS_GATE_OFF=1 (or true/yes/on). Any
# other value — including an unrecognized typo — leaves the gate active
